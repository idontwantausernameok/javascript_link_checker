javascript_link_checker
=======================

This contains a single javascript file and the bookmarklet code to check ANY* page for broken links.

How to install this:

1) Save this javascript file on your web server. (*Note: If you want to check pages served over https you will need to serve the javascript using https as well.)

2) Edit the bookmarklet code at the end of this javascript file to point to the location where you saved the javascript file on your web server, then save the bookmarklet as a bookmark in your browser.

3) Go to the page on your web site that you want to test.

4) Open the javascript console. You will want to see the status of the script, which, if you have many links on the page, may take awhile to run.

5) Click on the bookmarklet you just created. This will open a new window or tab (you will likely be asked to enable popups for this page/site, if so, enable popups for the site, then click on the boomkarklet again).

6) When the report is finished, you will be able to view the results of the test in the new window or tab.
